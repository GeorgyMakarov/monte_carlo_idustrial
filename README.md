# Use Monte Carlo simulation to make real life decisions effectively

Many small and medium size companies face difficult decisions they have to make 
during their budgeting process. Their management spends long hours dealing with 
uncertainties and trying to brainstorm a set of possible outcomes of different 
scenarios. Large part of that work can be done using modern computation tools 
giving more room and time for expert opinions in other fields.

This project shows how you can apply Monte Carlo simulation to help you make a 
decision on property investment budget. This is a real world example so it may 
require some thoughtful reading. Methods described here can be applied to any 
process dealing with uncertain future.
